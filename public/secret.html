  <h1>Secrets</h1>
<ol>
  <li>The code you see online often hides the ugly parts — tutorials skip the messy debugging and edge cases.</li>
  <li>Copy-pasting from Stack Overflow is a superpower — but only if you understand what the code does.</li>
  <li>Naming things is one of the hardest problems in programming — good names make code self-explanatory.</li>
  <li>80% of bugs usually come from 20% of the code — focus on those trouble spots.</li>
  <li>Programming is mostly debugging — fixing problems is the real job.</li>
  <li>“Temporary” code often becomes permanent — hacks tend to stick around for years.</li>
  <li>Your brain lies to you when debugging — always test assumptions, even obvious ones.</li>
  <li>Reading code is more important than writing code — you'll spend most of your career doing it.</li>
  <li>Senior developers don't know everything — they just search smarter and break problems into smaller steps.</li>
  <li>Version control is a time machine — Git can save you from your own mistakes.</li>
</ol>
